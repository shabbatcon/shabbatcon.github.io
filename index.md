![Shabbat con logo](shabbatcon.logo.png)

We are a group of religious Jews who get together at Defcon each year. We are trying to provide the infrastructure for religious Jews to attend the con by organizing minyanim, seudot, a track of talks on shabbat afternoon, and more. It's a great gathering that can be a welcome respite from the crazy crowds at Defcon and an opportunity to discuss some very unique perspectives on hacking.

[Our 2019 fundraising campaign is now live!](https://www.gofundme.com/f/shabbatcon) Donate and help us return for another year.
Check out [our schedule](/schedule) &amp; [No Fire Talks](/talks).
