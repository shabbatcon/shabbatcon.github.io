  <section class="about">
    <p>We are a group of religious Jews who get together at Defcon each year. Shabb@Con's goal is to provide the infrastructure for religious Jews to attend the con by organizing minyanim, seudot, a track of talks on Shabbat afternoon, and more. It’s a great gathering that can be a welcome respite from the crazy crowds at Defcon and an opportunity to discuss some very unique perspectives on hacking.</p>
	<p>Sadly, we've made the difficult but necessary decision to cancel Shabb@Con for 2020. <br />
	Many parts of Hacker culture are deeply tied to gathering in person, and we look forward to being able to resume those soon. Unfortunately, we cannot safely operate at Def Con this summer. Going "virtual" also does not make sense for us at this time.<br />
	The sanctity of human life is a cornerstone of Judaism. The extended closure of synagogues around the world has been extraordinarily difficult, but necessary. It's been heartening to see people remarkably united in fighting COVID-19 by not gathering to pray together. We at Shabb@Con exist at the intersection of Hacking & Halacha. We hope that the spirit of that continues on with you wherever you are, even though we may not be gathering together at Def Con in person this year.<br />
	We look forward to seeing you all again soon. Please stay safe out there, and be kind to each other.</p>
